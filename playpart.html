            KNUT BROVIK:[Rises suddenly, as if in distress, from the table; breathes heavily and laboriously as he comes forward into the doorway.] No, I can't bear it much longer!

            KAIA:[Going up to him.] You are feeling very ill this evening, are you not, Uncle?

            BROVIK:Oh, I seem to get worse every day.

            RAGNAR:[Has risen and advances.] You ought to go home, father. Try to get a little sleepâ€”

            BROVIK:[Impatiently.] Go to bed, I suppose? Would you have me stifled outright?

            KAIA:Then take a little walk.

            RAGNAR:Yes, do. I will come with you.
